        "Worked example: transferring a MessagePort plus SharedArrayBuffer between workers, detailing the syscall/IPC hooks and state transitions.",

        "Compare structured clone semantics to JSON.stringify and custom serializers, focusing on deep copy vs move semantics, fidelity, and performance cost.",
        "Expose common pitfalls: non-cloneable objects, detached buffers, cyclic prototypes, and undefined behaviour when engine hooks skip slot sealing.",
        "Detail resource-leak and signal-safety risks when cloning is interrupted (worker termination, cancellation) and mitigation strategies.",
