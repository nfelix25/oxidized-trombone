    "content": "Mutation and shadowing both re-express a value, yet they tell different safety stories. Treat them like two columns on ThermoTrack-7’s dashboard.\n**Mutation (state actually changes):**\n```rust\nfn mutate_fan_speed() {\n    let mut fan_rpm = 900; // intent: this binding evolves\n    fan_rpm += 150;        // raises RPM for a heat spike\n    fan_rpm /= 2;          // backs off after hallway cools\n    println!(\"mutable fan rpm={fan_rpm}\");\n}\n```\nHere the binding is single-owned; every change overwrites history. Useful for physical actuators (fans, pumps) where we model the real device state and need to retain mutability inside the same scope. The compiler enforces exclusive access, so borrowing rules stay strict.\n**Shadowing (value reinterpreted, history preserved):**\n```rust\nfn shadow_room_setpoint(raw_celsius: f64) {\n    let setpoint = raw_celsius;          // original reading stays intact\n    let setpoint = setpoint + 0.5;       // shadow to include sunlight offset\n    let setpoint = format!(\"{setpoint:.1}°C\"); // shadow again to present as text\n    println!(\"shadowed setpoint={setpoint}\");\n}\n```\nEach `let` introduces a fresh binding that can even change type (f64 → String) without requiring `mut`. This excels when a calculation moves through conceptual stages—calibration, adjustment, formatting—while preventing later code from accidentally mutating older values. Encourage learners to reach for mutation when modeling living state and shadowing when the identity of the data evolves. Both patterns keep Rust’s guarantees intact, but knowing which column you’re editing makes the thermostat’s report calmer and your future control-flow branches clearer.",
