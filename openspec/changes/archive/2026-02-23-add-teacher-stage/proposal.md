## Why

The current session loop goes directly from node selection to coding exercise with no teaching phase — the learner is expected to already know the material. Adding a teacher stage closes this gap by delivering a personalized lesson (concept explanation, worked examples, common pitfalls, and curated external resources) generated by Codex before the exercise begins.

## What Changes

- New `teacher` stage persona added to the stage pipeline, running after the planner and before the author
- New `lesson_content_v1` schema for teacher stage output: markdown lesson body, worked code examples, misconception callouts, and a `resources` array of curated links (Rust Book chapters, reference docs, playground links)
- Session start sequence becomes: planner → teacher → author → [learner studies + edits code] → reviewer/coach
- New `npm run session study` command re-displays the lesson content for the current session (mirrors `show` for exercises)
- Teacher context packet draws from the same live session state as other stages (mastery level, top misconception tags, node metadata)
- Teacher output stored in session state alongside exercise pack

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities
- `lesson-delivery`: Teacher stage schema (`lesson_content_v1`), stage runner integration, context packet construction, session state storage, `study` CLI command, fixtures

### Modified Capabilities
- `session-exercise-loop`: Session start gains a `teacher` step between planner and author; session state carries `lessonContent`; `study` command added alongside `show`/`attempt`/`hint`/`review`
- `codex-lesson-orchestration`: Teacher registered as a new valid stage in the stage pipeline alongside planner, author, coach, reviewer
- `learning-content-and-fixtures`: New `lesson_content_v1` schema file and valid/invalid fixture examples

## Impact

- `src/orchestration/stages.js`: Add `teacher` to `STAGE_TO_SCHEMA` map, export `runTeacherStage`
- `src/schemas/`: New `lesson_content_v1.schema.json`
- `src/session/exerciseLoop.js`: Insert teacher stage call between planner and author in `setupExercise`
- `src/session/session.js`: Add `studySession` handler; store `lessonContent` in session state; `createNewSession` gains `lessonContent: null`
- `src/session/cli.js`: Register `study` command
- `fixtures/valid/teacher/`, `fixtures/invalid/`: New fixture files
- `tests/`: New integration tests for teacher stage and study command
