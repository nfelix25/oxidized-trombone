Apply what you just learned: the function signature already tells you ownership comes in — your job is to return it so the caller gets it back.\n\n```rust\npub fn take_and_return(s: String) -> String {\n    // your implementation here\n}\n```\n\nThe test in `tests/tests.rs` checks that the returned value equals the original string. Once ownership is returned correctly, the test passes.\n",
